How to test Software

	I work as an intern in Netease. So I plan to do the testing plan on Netease product.
	
	PandaMentor, it's an English learning software. User listen the software and choose the right answer.
	
	Make sure that, the testing should be there when you begin to do the requirement from your customers. Like the waterfall model.
	
	The fundamental development activities of in the Waterfall model include: 
	
	1) requirements definition 2)system and software design 3) implementation and unit testing 3) integration and system testing 4) operation and maintenance. 
	
	Each activity supported by V&V techniques is supposed to produce of well-defined deliverables. Since the deliverables of one activity are the input for the subsequent activity, no subsequent phase can begin until the predecessor phase finishes and all of its deliverables are signed off as satisfactory.

	To complete the output must be approved by these QA activities. 
	
	Since we are concerned with the quality of the software produced with both the Waterfall model and the agile approach, we investigate quality-centric supporting processes in software development. 
	
	We concentrate on two of the most widely used general quality-focused processes, Software Quality Assurance(SQA) and Verification and Validation (V&V) to examine software product quality.
	
	"SQA governs the procedures meant to build the desired quality into the products" and V&V is aimed more directly at product quality including intermediate products. These two supporting processes are normally used to support the waterfall model in order to provide a full complete process model.
	Quality assurance techniques can be categorized into two types, static and dynamic. Static and dynamic techniques are both used in SQA processes. The selection, objectives, and organization of a particular technique depend on the requirements and nature of the project. A Waterfall development method selects these techniques according to very different criteria, such as some people-intensive techniques chosen in waterfall model.
	
	Unlike dynamic techniques, Static techniques do not involve the execution of code. Static techniques involve examination of documentation by individuals or groups, this examination maybe be assisted by software tools, for example, inspection of the requirements specification and technical reviews of the code. Testing and simulation are dynamic techniques. 
	
	Sometimes static techniques are used to support dynamic techniques and vice versa. The waterfall model uses both static and dynamic techniques. However, agile methods mostly use dynamic techniques. We will compare and contrast the quality assurance techniques used by these two approaches later in this paper.
	
	For an English learning software, the stability is very important, nobody want to be interrupt when they are learning. So i need to pay more attention on it.
	
	Based on Waterfall model, you can see the basic architecture of Software Quality Assurance, and we can do more than it.
