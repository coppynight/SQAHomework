                                          Summary of Week 2
                                                                                              13126152   Xiao Kai

    In fact, i'm familiar with the content of week 2. It's not the first time that i listened to develop model.

    But i'm also confused with these models, waterfall, V-model. When i'm in a developing group, and developing the project, in my view, i only can think about the technology problem, and try to solve it. It's not a good thing for me and my programmer career. Maybe it's caused by my poor experience of development and it will be better by the time passed.

    Nowadays, people talks more about agile development, but what's the real meaning of agile? When i as a intern in Amazon, the manager said that we need to be agile in development, and we need more communication than coding by yourself. So he held the agile meeting every morning at 9:00. We discusses what are we doing yesterday and the plan of today. I think it's a good way to increase communication in group, through everyday early wake up makes me crazy. 

    What i know of development model? First one is waterfall model, it's a classic and heavy model in development. Every engineer should know it. It's heavy and not sensible to change, like a old men. Then is the V-model, it's rigorous, and step by step make sure what you did is in the right way, it has the test process to record and verify each node in the development, it like a sedate middle-aged. We use agile development now, it's like the teenager, who is well adapted to the changeable requirement. I like the agile, less doc and more talk.

    In total, i need to increase my experience of developing, and try to understand the nature of these development models in my work.
