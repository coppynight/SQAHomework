  According to the first course, i know some basic concept about SQA, what's SQA? And what are they doing? How they affect the software development process.

  What's SQA? SQA is short for Software Quality Assurance. And the purpose of Software Quality Assurance is to provide management with appropriate visibility into the process being used by the project and of the products being built.

  Software Quality Assurance involves reviewing and auditing the software products and activities to verify that they comply with the applicable procedures and standards and providing the project and other appropriate managers with the results of the reviewing and audits.

  How to be a good SQA and how to affect the process? In my understanding now, we need to set some goals when you are working in a project as SQA. 
  Goal 1 -- Make software quality assurance activities are planned.
  Goal 2 -- Adherence of software products and activities to the applicable standards, procedures, and requirements is verified objectively.
  Goal 3 -- Affected groups and individuals are informed of software assurance activities and results.
  Goal 4 -- Noncompliance issues that can not be resolved within the project are addressed by senior management.

  The project must follows a written organizational policy for implementing software quality assurance.

  SQA needs to organize the software assurance activities in the high efficiency. They need to do many works on the software process. And i also want to know more about SQA. How they are exactly working in the group and how they manage other people?
